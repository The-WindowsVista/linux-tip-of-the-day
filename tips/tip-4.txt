************ cp command ************
------------------------------------

cp command is a basic shell command that is used to copy file(s) from one location to another. The basic syntax for the cp command is 
cp SOURCE DESTINATION
The SOURCE is the file (directory) location, the contents of which need to be copied and the DESTINATION is the file (directory) location where the contents need to be copied.
For example: To copy a file $HOME/orange.tmp to a location $HOME/tmp/, the following command can be issued on the terminal (command-line) window:
cp $HOME/orange.tmp $HOME/tmp/
Different options can be used to copy the files and/or directories. Some of the important ones are:
-v : cp command when used with this option, it will explain what is being done; long form: --verbose
-u : cp command when used with this option will copy only when the SOURCE file is newer than the destination file or when the destination file is missing. -u (update); long form: --update
-p : -p option is same as --preserve=mode, ownership, timestamps; --preserve preserves the specified attributes, and the default attributes are the ones that the -p option is equivalent to
-r : cp command when used with this option will copy directories recursively. -r (recursive); long form: --recursive; also -R can be used

This much for this time
