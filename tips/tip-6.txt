********** Tip of the day **********
------------------------------------
********** File globbing ***********
------------------------------------

Wild characters as well as use of square brackets help to filter and match patterns. The wild characters are:
* = meaning any
? = exactly one character
User of square brackets help to choose one of the possible options (characters) included inside the bracket. 
Examples of using file globbing:
ls *.txt will list all the files that has an extension of .txt
ls file*.txt will list all the files that has a word file followed by anything and have the extension of .txt
ls ticket.??? Will list all the files that has extensions consisting of any three character.
ls file[1234567890].tmp will list any file that has one number (0 to 9) after the word file and has the extension .tmp.
Regular expression can also be used with file globbing.

This much for this time
